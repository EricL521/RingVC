# RingVC
A discord bot that "calls"* people when someone joins an empty vc in a server that they signed up for
* Discord bots can't actually call people, so it just DMs them
* There's a config.json file too, but it's added to gitignore
	* Needs "token", which is the discord token used for security
	* Also, a "saveCooldown", which is how long it waits between saving, if needed

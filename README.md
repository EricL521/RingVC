# RingVC
A discord bot that tries to replicate Group Chat behavior in server Voice Channels
- Servers can't ring people, like in Group Chats, so bot just pings people in the Voice Channel Text Chats instead

## Usage
To add the bot to your server, click [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=885686322973536267)
### Commands
- **/help**
	- A quick description of all the commands
- **/signup**
	- signs you up for a voice channel, so once someone "starts" a call there (joins it when it's empty), you get pinged
- **/unsignup**
	- un-signs you up for a voice channel, so you no longer get pinged
- **/ring**
	- pings someone to join the voice channel you're currently in
- **/block**
	- blocks someone, which prevents them from ringing you and makes it so you don't get pinged if they start a call
- **/unblock**
	- unblocks someone
<a name="mode"></a>
- **/mode**
	- allows you to switch between auto, normal, and stealth modes
 		- stealth means that you don't ping anyone when "starting" a call
